Set + Achieve goals

Self-esteem
Locus of control
Incentives

Stop wishing. Start doing.

Common types of self-motivators:
  - Collaborators - driven by relationships (acceptance, support, encouragement)
  - Directors - challenge, competition (hard outcomes, results)
  - Stabilizers - appreciate equilibrium (gaining deep knowledge, becoming the expert)
  - Innovators - imagine possibilities and invent

What energizes you is different from what will energize your colleagues.

self-reliance - relying on your own power, not the power of others
  > be proactive
  > make decisions on your own
  > hold yourself accountable
  
self-talk -> self-motivation -> performance -> self-talk -> self-motivation -> ...
Positive self-talk can lower stress and rumination and improve achievement.

- visualizing your goals
- motivate yourself by starting (Start today. There's no time like the present.)
- small rewards (You'll persevere through difficult projects and you'll find the grit to finish strong.)
- micro to-dos (Think big, start small.)

Fail forward.
