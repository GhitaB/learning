1. Small garden

      1. Nutrient cycling - composting
      2. Vertical space - increase the production with 1/3
      3. Microclimate
      4. Diversity - shape, form, color - confuse the pects,
                                        - favor the predators
      5. Mix your annuals & perennials => stability & diversity
      6. Control your edges and the ends

2. Too much water
      Water is a very valuable component
      Air - too

      > anaerobic soils     water
      > aerobic soils       air

      * raised beds

3. Ethics         - Earth care

                  - Return of surplus (for care of earth and people)
