1. Small garden
      aspect
      contour   footpaths, garden beds, container garden

      1. Nutrient cycling - composting
      2. Vertical space - increase the production with 1/3
      3. Microclimate
      4. Diversity - shape, form, color - confuse the pects,
                                        - favor the predators
      5. Mix your annuals & perennials => stability & diversity
      6. Control your edges and the ends

2. Too much water
      Water is a very valuable component
      Air - too

      > anaerobic soils     water
      > aerobic soils       air

      * raised beds
      * rocks
      * mounds
      * contour
      * drainage


3. Ethics         - Earth care
                  - Care of people
                  - Return of surplus (for care of earth and people)

Geoff Lawton - What is Sustainability?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permaculture design is the integration of land, resources, people, and the
environment. It creates a closed-loop system, beneficial to the environment
and people, in which all the elements in the system are provided for and the
waste used. For example, a garden produces food, the food waste makes compost
to provide fertility, and people eat while the garden’s fertility needs are
met. Only closed-loop systems like this are truly sustainable.

Sustainability is a state that provides more energy than it consumes. The
elements constantly improve but don’t require constant inputs from elsewhere.
The closed-loop arrangement provides for its own needs and benefits the
environments. When you think through design, how plants and animals interact,
you realize that everything we need we have around us.
