Sleep Is Your Superpower
Nancy H. Rothstein, MBA

You must sleep to live.
Sleep is mandatory for life.
Only you can sleep for you.
Sleep has a very powerful impact on everything you do when you're awake.
  How productive you are,
  how you show up at work in meetings,
  how you interact with your colleagues, your family, and loved ones.


sleep deprivation had its own risks for life, for health, and at work.

we're required and designed to sleep
Our biology has not changed, our behaviors have.
not so sleep-friendly.
